# WorkDaySchedule-CH05

## This weeks challenge was to use the source code that was provided to generate a work day scheduler. We were given a complete html and css file as well as a brifely started javascript file. My biggest challange was crratign the functions in the js file and having them work. I had a lot of trouble finding help to the problems I was having but eventually was able to figure it out. I really enjoyed this project and will refer back to it in the future to create more scheduler applications.

Your Task
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
You'll need to use the Day.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.
